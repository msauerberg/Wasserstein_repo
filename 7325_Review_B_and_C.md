COMMENTS TO AUTHOR(S):

Main Strengths:

Although the topic of the distances between demographic distributions is an old one, it is rarely addressed in formal demography. Therefore, a new contribution to this field would be very welcome. I was very excited about this prospect when I agreed to review the manuscript.

 

Main Weaknesses:

Unfortunately, the draft did not meet my expectations. In short, the main result is rather trivial and has little to do with the Wasserstein distance or any other formal distance measure presented in Eq. (1). This is clearly stated in the second part of Eq. (10): The difference in life expectancy is the difference in the respective populations' integrated survival. Essentially, life expectancy is defined as integrated survival, and this has nothing to do with the Wasserstein distance (or any of the others presented in (1)). In fact, it is a more general proposition than that presented as the paper's result. Unfortunately, I see no added value for demographers here. It is rather superfluous to state that a positive number equals its own absolute value. Also, the interpretation of life expectancy as the mean age at death is well known in formal demography.

 

I regret coming to such an unfavourable conclusion. However, I would urge the authors not to be upset, but to consider other avenues of meaningful research on 'distances' in demography. In this context, I would advise them to check the works of Tuljapurkar, Kim, Schoen and myself (the latter of which was published in this very journal) and extend the field further. The authors do have all the necessary capabilities to do this, which are rarely found among demographers.

Main Strengths:

As stated in its title, this paper shows that whenever the survivorship functions of two age-at-death distributions do not cross, then the differences in the corresponding life expectancies at birth corresponds exactly to the Wasserstein distance between the corresponding age-at-death distributions. The paper is very clearly written and is technically (almost) impeccable (the legends in Figure 2 seem to be incorrect, the labels of the curves should refer to the US and Germany, not US in 1990 and in 2019). 

 

Main Weaknesses:

While the paper is technically and formally correct, I believe its added value is quite small. The mathematical derivation of the main result in section 2 is extremely simple. In addition, devoting 7 equations (from (11) to (17)) to show that life expectancy at birth can be written as the mean of the age-at-death distribution (a result that is widely known by most researchers interested in formal demography) looks strange/naive to me. Overall, I do not believe that readers gain many novel insights after reading the paper. 

 

Recommendations to Author:

While I am sympathetic to the overall idea of the paper, I cannot avoid thinking that its added value is very small. Unfortunately, it is not clear to me how the paper can be improved. The only thing that comes to my mind to strengthen the paper somewhat is the following. Consider two survival curves A and B that cross at most at one point (i.e., this includes pairs of curves that do not cross -- I guess this includes most pairs of survival curves from the HMD database, but it should be checked whether some pairs cross more than once). Then one could decompose the corresponding differences in life expectancies (e0_A - e0_B) as "the part attributable to the advantage of A over B" and "the part attributable to the advantage of B over A". Assuming that the survival curve of A lies above that of B from ages 0 until x, then "the part attributable to the advantage of A over B" would be the difference between the area below the survival curve of A and the area below the survival curve of B when integrating both between 0 until x. Analogously for "the part attributable to the advantage of B over A" (in that case integrating from x until omega). In case the two curves do not overlap, then one term of the decomposition is equal to zero. Following this approach, we can quantify how much "compensation" occurs across different age ranges, which I think is a little bit more informative. That said, I should say that I am not super-enthusiastic about the suggested "improvement", though.
