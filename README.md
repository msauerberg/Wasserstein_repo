I used the Wasserstein distance to compare age-at-death distributions in one-dimension (all-cause mortality) and in two-dimensions (cause-specific mortality). All my material can be found in this repo.
Data comes Human Moratality Database.

# Paper

The some of this work was submitted to Demographic Research but rejected because its added value was deemed limited. Yet, there was consensus about the technical correctness.

# PDF: Markdown

The markdown document includes R code. The R code for the 2 dimensional Wasserstein distance is wrong. Please use the Python code instead.
